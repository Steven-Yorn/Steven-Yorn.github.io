This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).\

Resaerch Insterests
======
Fascinated by [**Quantum Materials**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_materials), I aim to develop robust and efficient methodologies to study the emergent quantum phenomena in quantum materials.

Currently, I am foucused on several projects:

1. **Construction of the World's First Scanning-4-Probe Microscope**: I have debugged technical issues of its sputtering & annealing system and re-assembled this system to process the gold surface, obtaining atomic terraces on Au \( 111 \).

2. **2D Optical Quasicrystalline lattices with Tunable Geometry Phases**: I have completed the methodology to manipulate the dynamics of optical lattices and currently I am studying the higher-dimensional space of the quasicrystals.

3. **STM Research on Charge Density Waves of Rare-Earth Compounds**: Currently I am searching the CDW features and critical point of a specific rare-earth compound with STM.
