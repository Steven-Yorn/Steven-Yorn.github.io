I am Yu Yao, a senior undergraduate at [School of Physical Sciences](http://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/mainm.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Changgan Zeng@USTC](http://www.hfnl.ustc.edu.cn/detail?id=11337), [Prof. Charles Brown@Yale](https://physics.yale.edu/people/charles-brown) and [Prof. Jenny Hoffman@Harvard](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/hoffman).

Resaerch Insterests
======
In pursuit of being a condensed matter physics experimentalist, my research is driven by the goal of developing robust and efficient methodologies for delving into the fundamental properties of novel materials and uncover the nature of superconductivity.

Currently, I am foucused on several projects:

1. **World's First Four-Scanning Probe STM Construction**: I am actively engaged in constructing the world's first four-scanning probe STM system.

2. **Dynamical Quasicrystals and Tunable Geometry Phases**: My research involves developing the theory of dynamical quasicrystals and tunable geometry phases. This work aims to provide a feasible mathematical model, which I refer to as the "Multi Penrose-tiling Configuration Space," to better understand the nature of quasicrystals.

3. **Automation of Ultra High Vacuum STM-MBE-Interconnected System**: I am working on automating an Ultra High Vacuum STM-Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) interconnected system to enhance its efficiency and precision.

4. **Exploring Unique Properties of Novel Materials**: My research extends to the investigation of the unique behaviors and properties of novel materials. This includes exploring phenomena such as one-dimensional solitons and the behavior of pentacene/picene on Au(110) substrates through quantum simulations.
