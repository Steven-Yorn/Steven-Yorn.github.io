I have a profound interest in the field of condensed matter physics and AL4Science (Artificial Intelligence for Science). My research is driven by the goal of developing robust and efficient methodologies for delving into the fundamental properties of materials while also creating dependable experimental tools to enhance our understanding of physical theories, simulations, and experiments. With a strong foundation in both Physics and Computer Science, my ambition is to uncover novel CMT models, advance machine learning techniques, and explore innovative materials.

Currently, my research encompasses several compelling projects that span condensed matter theory, precision control methods, robotic-human interactive engineering, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) techniques:

1. **World's First Four-Scanning Probe STM Construction**: I am actively engaged in constructing the world's first four-scanning probe STM system.

2. **Dynamical Quasicrystals and Tunable Geometry Phases**: My research involves developing the theory of dynamical quasicrystals and tunable geometry phases. This work aims to provide a feasible mathematical model, which I refer to as the "Multi Penrose-tiling Configuration Space," to better understand the nature of quasicrystals.

3. **Automation of Ultra High Vacuum STM-MBE-Interconnected System**: I am working on automating an Ultra High Vacuum STM-Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) interconnected system via deep learning to enhance its efficiency and precision.

4. **Exploring Unique Properties of Novel Materials**: My research extends to the investigation of the unique behaviors and properties of novel materials. This includes exploring phenomena such as one-dimensional solitons and the behavior of pentacene/picene on Au(110) substrates through quantum simulations.

Through these projects, I aim to contribute to the advancement of our understanding of condensed matter physics and the development of cutting-edge AI tools for scientific research.
